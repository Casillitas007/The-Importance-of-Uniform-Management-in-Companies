👔 The Importance of Uniform Management in Companies
This project simulates an automated BPM (Business Process Management) system for managing uniform distribution in companies. It includes a user-friendly web interface that demonstrates HR onboarding, inventory checking, budget validation, and supplier order workflows—all in real time.

Developed as part of the MSc in AI for Business at the National College of Ireland.
